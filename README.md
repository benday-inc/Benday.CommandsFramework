# Commands Framework

I feel like I'm always writing command line tools. I've had a framework for writing utility commands for years and I figured that 
I'd share it with everyone.  

I'll put more info into this README later but if you have questions, feel free to email me at info@benday.com.

Thanks,
-Ben
